# Guide for standalone and distributed inferencing on GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)

This exercise assumes you have a fine-tuned model, that we would like to serve on GKE.
If you have followed the previous steps for dataprep and finetune you would have a model store in the GCS bucket in your GCP Project.

### A quick brief on Inference on VLLM.

There are three common strategies for inference on vLLM:

- Single GPU (no distributed inference)
- Single-Node Multi-GPU (tensor parallel inference)
- Multi-Node Multi-GPU 

In this guide, you would serve a Gemma large language model (LLM) using graphical processing units (GPUs) on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) with the vLLM serving framework with the above mentioned deployment strategies.You can choose to swap the Gemma model with any other fine-tuned or instruction based model for inference on GKE.

By the end of this guide, you should be able to perform the following steps:

                [ Place holder for concept diagram]

1. Prepare your ML Platform [Playground]( https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ai-on-gke/tree/ml-platform-dev/best-practices/ml-platform/examples/platform/playground).
2. Create a Persistent Disk for the LLM model weights.
2. Deploy a vLLM container to your cluster to host your model.
3. Use vLLM to serve the Gemma7B model through curl and a web chat interface.
4. View Production metrics for your model serving on GKE
5. Use custom metrics and HPA to scale your model deployments(instances) on GKE.

### Prerequisites
1. The ML Platform [Playground]( https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ai-on-gke/tree/ml-platform-dev/best-practices/ml-platform/examples/platform/playground) must be deployed
2. Data Set output from the [Data Preparation example](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ai-on-gke/tree/ml-platform-dev/best-practices/ml-platform/examples/use-case/datapreparation/gemma-it)
3. Fine tune or other model available ready to be served.If you have been following the [fine tuning exercise with gemma model](https://<github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ai-on-gke/tree/ml-platform-dev/best-practices/ml-platform/examples/use-case/finetuning/pytorch), a model artifact would be availble to use in [your model artifacts GCS bucket](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ai-on-gke/tree/ml-platform-dev/best-practices/ml-platform/examples/use-case/finetuning/pytorch)
4. Set these Enviorment variables.

```
PROJECT_ID=your-project-id>
PROJECT_NUMBER=$(gcloud projects describe ${PROJECT_ID} --format="value(projectNumber)")
V_MODEL_BUCKET=<model-artifacts-bucket>
CLUSTER_NAME=<your-gke-cluster>
NAMESPACE=ml-serve
KSA=<k8s-service-account>
HF_TOKEN=<your-Hugging-Face-account-token>
MODEL_ID=<your-model-id>
REGION=<your-region>
IMAGE_NAME=<your-image-name>
DISK_NAME=<your-disk-name>
```

## Single GPU (no distributed inference)

If your model fits in a single GPU, you probably donâ€™t need to use distributed inference. Just use the single GPU to run the inference.
You can follow the steps similiar to the Single-Node Multi-GPU (tensor parallel inference)

## Single-Node Multi-GPU (tensor parallel inference):

If your model is too large to fit in a single GPU, but it can fit in a single node with multiple GPUs, you can use tensor parallelism. The tensor parallel size is the number of GPUs you want to use. For example, if you have 4 GPUs in a single node, you can set the tensor parallel size to 4.

#### Prepare your environment with a GKE cluster in Standard mode.

Follow along the steps provide in this README.md( https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ai-on-gke/tree/ml-platform-dev/best-practices/ml-platform/examples/platform/playground) to create a playground cluster for ML platform on GKE.

You can also re-use the cluster from previous fine-tuning and dataprep exercise as mentioned in pre-requistes.

From the CLI connect to the GKE cluster

```
gcloud container clusters get-credentials ${CLUSTER_NAME} --region $REGION
```

```
kubectl create ns ${NAMESPACE}
```

```
kubectl create sa ${KSA} -n ${NAMESPACE}
```

#### Create a Persistent Disk for the LLM model weights

If you already have LLM model and weights uploaded to a bucket location( as mentioned above) then skip creation of bucket.

##### Optional :  Upload the model and weights to GCS bucket.

Create a GCS bucket in the same region as your GKE cluster.

```
gcloud storage buckets create gs://${V_MODEL_BUCKET} --location ${REGION}
```

Grant permission to kubernetes service account in cluster to access the storage bucket to view model weights

```
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding "gs://$V_MODEL_BUCKET" \
--member "principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/"$PROJECT_NUMBER"/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/${PROJECT_ID}.svc.id.goog/subject/ns/$NAMESPACE/sa/$KSA" \
--role "roles/storage.objectViewer"
```

Update the bucket access level to uniform.

```
gcloud storage buckets update "gs://$V_MODEL_BUCKET"  --uniform-bucket-level-access
```

Download the model to your local environment. For example, here we are downloading a model from hugging face.

In your local enviornment, install hugging face hub using pip :

```
pip3 install huggingface_hub
```

Download the model using python3 script.:

Note: The model_id that you provided in the script will be downloaded locally to your /tmp/models folder.

```
python3 serving-yamls/download_model_hugging_face.py
```

Upload the model to the GCS bucket.

```
MODEL_ID=<your_model_id> # eg: google/gemma-1.1-7b-it
MODEL_ORG="$(dirname "$MODEL_ID")"      
gsutil cp -r /tmp/models/$MODEL_ORG/  gs://$V_MODEL_BUCKET
```

##### Create PV, PVC and Persistent disk.

Loading model weights from Persistent Volume is one of solutions to load models faster on GKE cluster. In GKE, Persistent Volumes backed by GCP Persistent Disks can be mounted read-only simultaneously  by multiple nodes(ReadOnlyMany), this makes multiple pods access the model weights possible. 

1. Create a PVC for the model weights

```
kubectl apply -f serving-yamls/pvc_disk_image.yaml
```

2. Create a job downloading the models to the volume and review logs for successful completion.

```
sed -i -e "s|_YOUR_BUCKET_NAME_|${V_MODEL_BUCKET}|" serving-yamls/batch_job_download_model_on_pv_volume.yaml
kubectl create -f serving-yamls/batch_job_download_model_on_pv_volume.yaml
kubectl logs  module-download-job-ptdpt-6cq8r
```

Wait for the job to show completion.

```
module-download-job-sg6j7-4bxg4
```

3. Create the PV and PVC

```
PV_NAME="$(kubectl get pvc/block-pvc-model -o jsonpath='{.spec.volumeName}')"
```

```
DISK_REF="$(kubectl get pv "$PV_NAME"  -o jsonpath='{.spec.csi.volumeHandle}')"
```

```
gcloud compute images create model-weights-image --source-disk="$DISK_REF"
```

```
gcloud compute disks create models-fine-tune-disk-v1  --size=1TiB --type=pd-ssd --zone=<enter-your-zone> --image=model-weights-image
Note: Choose a zone based on cluster location and gpu availability
```

```
sed -i -e "s|_NAMESPACE_|${NAMESPACE}|" serving-yamls/pv_and_pvc.yaml
kubectl apply -f serving-yamls/pv_and_pvc.yaml
```

       
#### Deploy a vLLM container to your cluster.

Run the batch job to deploy model using persistent disk on GKE.

```
NAMESPACE=<your-inference-namespace>
ACCELERATOR_TYPE=<gpu-accelerator-type> #e.g nvidia-l4

sed -i -e "s|_NAMESPACE_|${NAMESPACE}|" serving-yamls/batch_job_model_deployment.yaml
sed -i -e "s|_ACCELERATOR_TYPE_|${ACCELERATOR_TYPE}|" serving-yamls/batch_job_model_deployment.yaml

```

```
kubectl create -f serving-yamls/model_deployment.yaml
kubectl describe pods vllm-openai-<replace-the-pod-name> -n ${NAMESPACE}
```

```
INFO:     Started server process [1]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```


#### Use vLLM to serve the Gemma7B model through curl and a web chat interface.

Serve the model

#### Production Metrics
vLLM exposes a number of metrics that can be used to monitor the health of the system. These metrics are exposed via the /metrics endpoint on the vLLM OpenAI compatible API server.

The following metrics are exposed:

```


```

#### Custom metrics for Single GPU Deployment.
